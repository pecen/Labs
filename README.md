# Labs

These solutions holds different labs where I'm testing new coding techniques or new technologies, where I'm changing an existing solution I've most often already done in the Tutorials or Courses repo (which then most likely comes from Youtube, Udemy, or Pluralsight or similar). The reason is that I want to apply/test techniques I find better or techniques I want to test in conjunction with the demonstrated tutorial/course. This means that I take the finished solution from the tutorial or course repo and use it as a starting point for modification in my Labs repo. It could for instance be a Wpf-solution where the original solution holds code-behind (becuase the original example from the tutorial/course most likely is about demonstrating something else and code-behind was used for simplicity), and where I want to change to Mvvm, or maybe test the demonstrated tutorial/course with for instance Prism or CSLA etc. 

As opposed to the Sandbox repo, where there are very simple solutions with no folder structure and where the purpose is just to quickly test a given coding technique or technology, here you have the full folder structure as you would have in a normal full fledged Development repo/solution. 

### Solutions

1. MVVM Dialog Service using strictly Mvvm - Added 230804 
	- Original solution from Tutorials repo (YouTube tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8hEjLahNtU&t=885s)
	- Original solution name - Showing Dialogs in an MVVM Application with a Dialog Service (Prism)
	- Folder: Mvvm Dialog Service
	- Solution name: DialogService.sln
	- Framework: .Net 7.0
	- Purpose: To extend the original solution with pure Mvvm and no code-behind, and use Prism fully out. Possibly some extra functionality as well along the way.
 	- Outcome: Fill in here what is accomplished and what the outcome became when the lab is finished.

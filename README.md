# Labs

This solutions holds different labs where I'm testing new coding techniques or new technologies, where I'm changing an existing solution I've most often already done in the Tutorials or Courses repo. The reason is that I want to apply techniques I find better or want to test. That could for instance be a Wpf-solution where the original solution holds code-behind (becuase the example most likely is about testing something else and code-behind was used for simplicity), and where I want to change to Mvvm.

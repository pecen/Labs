# Labs

This solutions holds different labs where I'm testing new coding techniques or new technologies, where I'm changing an existing solution I've most often already done in the Tutorials or Courses repo (which then most likely comes from Youtube, Udemy, or Pluralsight or similar). The reason is that I want to apply/test techniques I find better or want to test in conjunction with the demonstrated tutorial/course. This means that I take the finished solution from the tutorial/course and use it as a starting point for modification. It could for instance be a Wpf-solution where the original solution holds code-behind (becuase the example most likely is about demonstrating something else and code-behind was used for simplicity), and where I want to change to Mvvm, or maybe test the demonstrated tutorial/course with for instance Prism etc.
